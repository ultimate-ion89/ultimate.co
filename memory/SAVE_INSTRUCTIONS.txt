# User Data Auto-Save Setup

## How to Save User Data to Folder Automatically

### Option 1: Using the Browser (Automatic Download)
When you sign up or log in, two files will download:
1. `users_data.txt` - Readable text file with all user info
2. `temp_users.json` - Temporary JSON file

Simply move these files to your game folder after they download.

### Option 2: Using Node.js (Auto-Save to Folder)

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer
2. Open PowerShell in the memory folder
3. Run this command:
   ```
   node save-users.js
   ```
4. Leave it running in the background
5. Now when you sign up/login, the `temp_users.json` will be downloaded
6. Move the downloaded `temp_users.json` to the memory folder
7. The script will automatically create/update `users_data.txt` in the folder
8. The temp file will be deleted automatically
